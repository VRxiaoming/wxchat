					<h3>For International Visitors</h3>
                    <h2>About language assistance</h2>
					<p>If you do not speak Chinese, please go to the International Healthcare Center (IHC), which is located on the 11th Floor of Building 1 at the Hospital's Qingchun Campus. The front desk staff at the IHC will manage to provide for you an interpreter, who will help you through all procedures until at the end of your visit. No additional cost is charged for the language assistance. </p>
<p>If you can speak Chinese, it is highly advised that you go through the registration and other procedures just as Chinese patients do, since language assistance might not be available when there are many international patients. </p>
<p>If your Chinese is not good enough but you speak English, we encourage you to talk to the doctors face-to-face, as many of the Hospital's physicians speak fluent English.</p>
<h2>About the requirements</h2>
<p>If it is your first visit to the Hospital, you are required to bring your passport or other valid ID certificates with you, fill out the first-visitor information form, and acquire a Patient ID card at the registration office. The card will be used all through your stay in the Hospital. Keep the card in case future visits will be needed. </p>
<p>Payment is to be made in RMB, the Chinese currency. Foreign currencies are not accepted for the time being. </p>
<h2>About the procedures</h2>
<pre>(1) Registration
Let the registration office staff know which clinic is your choice, pay the registration charge and get the registration sheet and the medical record book. 
The registration office outlets are located on the 3rd to 8th floors of Building 1.</pre>
<pre>(2) Waiting for consultation with the doctor
    After registration, go to the clinic (whose location is printed on the registration sheet) and have a little rest at the waiting area before your number is pronounced. Produce your Patient ID card and the medical record book when your consultation with the doctor begins. </pre>
<pre>(3) Getting check-ups
    Laboratory tests or other examinations are usually needed in the diagnostic process. Follow the directory signs to go to the location printed on check-up form to get the check-ups, after paying the fee at the cashier's office. </pre>
<pre>(4) Making payment
    Produce the check-up form or prescription sheet, together with your Patient ID card, when making payment at the cashier's office, whose outlets are located on the 3rd to 8th floors of Building 1 together with those of the registration office. </pre>
    <pre>(5) Getting the check-up reports
For some check-ups, the reports will be handed over to the patients shortly after the check-ups are made. For some other check-ups, a blood test for example, the reports will not be immediately available, and the patients are required to get the report sheets at the help-yourself print machines located on the 2nd Floor of Building 1.  </pre>
    <pre>(6) Getting the medicine
After paying the money for the prescribed medicine, go to the dispensary on the 2nd Floor of Building 1, find out the window on whose screen your name is displayed, produce your Patient ID card and get the medicine. 
Follow the doctor's or the pharmacist's advice to take the medicine. </pre>
